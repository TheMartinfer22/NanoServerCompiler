* 🤔 How does it work??
  * Looks for a server jar in the folder, if it doesn't find it it will download.

  * Compile using maven command and move jar to plugins folder (replace if already exist). 
  * Done.
  
* ✨ What's to come?
  * More code optimizations.
  * Possibility of change jar server.
  * Initialize server.
  * More config options in properties.
